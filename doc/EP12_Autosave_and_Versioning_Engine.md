### Overview

Implement an autosave mechanism that periodically stores document content to disk and database while preserving version history. The system should introduce a latency buffer (~800ms) to minimize write operations.

### User Stories

#### EP12‑US‑01 — Real‑Time Autosave

**As a** user **I want** my changes to be saved automatically **so that** I never lose work even if I forget to save manually.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Changes saved automatically after 800ms of inactivity.
- Save triggers DB version creation and disk write.
- Autosave indicator shows visual confirmation.
- Failure gracefully retries or warns user.

**Development Tests:**

- Unit: Autosave triggers after debounce delay.
- Integration: DB and disk versions consistent.
- Reliability: Crash recovery restores last autosaved version.

**QA Tests:**

- E2E: Edit document for 60 seconds → restart app → confirm changes persist.
- Performance: Autosave under heavy typing maintains <1s response.

#### EP12‑US‑02 — Version Creation

**As a** user **I want** every autosave to create a new version entry **so that** I can review or rollback to older states.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- New DB entry created per autosave event.
- Metadata: file_id, version_id, timestamp, hash.
- Rollback possible through version controller.

**Development Tests:**

- Unit: Version count increments correctly.
- Integration: Rollback restores previous version.

**QA Tests:**

- E2E: Edit document thrice → verify 3 versions in history.
- Regression: Rollback restores correct version content.
