# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## AI‑Native Project Documentation Workspace

### Extension to Personal Knowledge Retriever (MCP‑enabled)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The AI‑Native Project Documentation Workspace extends the current Personal Knowledge Retriever into a complete documentation authoring environment.  
It enables project teams to **create, edit, version, and manage documentation assets** such as notes, requirements, user stories, and epics within a local‑first environment.  
This evolution transforms the system from a passive retrieval tool into an **active knowledge management and creation platform**, designed for AI‑assisted productivity.

---

## 2. Business Context & Problem Statement

The existing platform provides search, summarization, and Q&A over indexed documents but lacks native authoring and structured content management capabilities.  
Users currently rely on external editors and manual indexing, which fragments the workflow and risks losing version history.

The proposed extension centralizes all documentation activities in one environment, ensuring consistency, traceability, and continuous availability of AI‑assisted authoring.

## 3. Goals and KPIs

### Goals

- Introduce **in‑app Markdown authoring** with full editing controls.
- Provide **real‑time autosave** and **automatic versioning** of documents.
- Enable **two‑way LLM integration** for generating or refining content.
- Maintain **local‑first storage** with filesystem synchronization.
- Ensure **instant re‑indexing** after edits or new document creation.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- 100% of created files automatically indexed within 2 seconds after save.
- Autosave latency: <1 second from user input to persistence.
- Zero data loss during continuous editing sessions.
- Average version retrieval time <200ms for 1k document corpus.

---

## 4. Scope

### In‑Scope

- Project‑level document creation (notes, requirements, epics, user stories).
- Markdown‑based WYSIWYG editor with formatting toolbar.
- Real‑time autosave and version management.
- Local file synchronization and database persistence.
- Two‑way LLM collaboration for authoring and refinement.
- Automatic indexing integration with Q&A and search.

### Out‑of‑Scope

- Cloud or Git synchronization (future enhancement).
- Collaborative multi‑user editing.
- Access control or user roles.

---

## 5. Key Use Cases

1. **Create and Manage Documentation** — Users author structured content directly in the app.
2. **AI‑Assisted Authoring** — Users request full drafts or content refinements from LLMs.
3. **Version History and Comparison** — Each edit creates a new version accessible via timeline view.
4. **Auto‑Indexing and Retrieval** — New and updated documents become immediately searchable.
5. **Project Context Integration** — Created documents link automatically to active project folders.

## 7. Business Requirements

| ID   | Requirement            | Description                                                                  |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BR‑1 | Markdown Authoring     | Provide a built‑in Markdown editor with syntax support and toolbar controls. |
| BR‑2 | Autosave & Versioning  | Save edits in near real time and maintain version history in DB.             |
| BR‑3 | LLM‑Assisted Authoring | Support AI generation and refinement from user prompts.                      |
| BR‑4 | Project Integration    | Automatically associate documents with the active project.                   |
| BR‑5 | Local Synchronization  | Persist edits to disk and maintain DB consistency.                           |
| BR‑6 | Auto‑Indexing          | Re‑index changed documents automatically after save.                         |
| BR‑7 | Version Retrieval      | Enable rollback and comparison between document versions.                    |

## 8. Assumptions & Constraints

- Local‑first design remains mandatory.
- Database engine supports version storage efficiently (SQLite/Postgres).
- LLM integration must adhere to configurable token and rate limits.
- Editor operations must be functional offline.
- No cloud dependency introduced in MVP.

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                        | Impact                   | Mitigation                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Excessive version creation  | High storage usage       | Implement delayed autosave (500–1000ms buffer).   |
| Disk/DB desynchronization   | Data inconsistency       | Scheduled reconciliation and integrity checks.    |
| AI hallucination in content | Inaccurate documentation | Add “review required” flag for AI‑generated text. |
| File system conflicts       | Overwritten edits        | Version timestamps and integrity hashes.          |
